            <p>For the last 10 years I've worked in healthcare as an ophthalmic technician and thuroughly enjoyed my interactions with people.  That said, I knew it wasn't what I wanted, or was meant, to do as my lifes work.  I have been blessed with an amazing wife and two beautiful, healthy, and smart children (they must take after their mother in all the aforementioned characteristics).</p>
            <p>Besides my last decade working in healthcare, I feel like I've spent countless years exploring what I want to be when I grow up (i’m still toying with the idea of being an astronaut or a firefighter).  In full disclosure, there’s been a common theme that's threaded itself throughout my life.  That theme is a love of technology and figuring out how to optimize its usage.  Technology, both hardware and software have this seductive allure which drives me to want to understand how it works.  Throughout my life I have been the go-to guy for those around me to setup, fix, or figure out how to make "things" work.  My in-laws even nicknamed me "Gabe On Demand" or G.O.D. for short.  Honestly it’s kinda cute, but since they let me marry their daughter… it fits, I am on demand for them.</p>
            <p>Aside from career paths and work experience and the circuitous route I've taken to be where I am today, I have done a lot in my lifetime.  I grew up in the East Suburbs of Cleveland, moved to Vermont and then to Colorado.  In Vermont I did a lot of hiking and camping, but in Colorado I summited ten 14,000 foot mountains.  I kayaked and rafted myriad rivers and ski'd and snowboarded lots of mountains.  I have also traveled a lot.  I've actually driven through 48 of our 50 States, only missing Alaska and South Dakota (yes I've driven in Hawaii, but not to Hawaii).  The photo I chose for my portfolio is from this last summer when my wife and I went to Iceland for 10 days and drove around the entire island.  I am really excited for this next adventure into my new career path!  Can't imagine having the ability to maintain productivity while having fun!  The common career offers either/or, not the and option.  So cool!</p>
            <p>Just because I happen to have been fortunate enough to have done a lot in my lifetime the desire to do so much more has only been fueled by past experiences.  I'm excited to provide my children with these experiences that will fuel them to strive for more.  Let's say, I've only just begun!</p>
